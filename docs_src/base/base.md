Basic Modules
=============

The base modules generally contain methods used by many other modules. These can be for example
internal consistency checks, the [logger](../contributions/logging.md) short methods for streamlining 
coding in the Toolbox, or methods to parallelize or compile parts of the code. If you have a hard
time reading numpy array syntax; or if you like to have nicely formatted output; or if you want
to make sure your function received the correct kinds of arguments; or if you want to make your
code faster, we recommend that you have a look into these modules.
