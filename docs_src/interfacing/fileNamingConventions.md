# Dealing with naming conventions from other collaborations 

Not every collaboration names their files in the same way. On the other hand, there are a few prominent collaborations
that have their own naming schemes. It can make it easier for you to read in their files, if you can generate
these names automatically. Moreover some collaborations like to use third-party tools that have specific file
format requirements, and it is helpful to be able to read these in. Being able to interface within this highly
heterogeneous field is an important part of interoperability.

To this end, the LatticeToolbox has some methods specifically for this purpose. At the moment we support
- MILC code configuration naming schemes
- HotQCD configuration naming schemes
- Reading GPL files
- Reading YAML files
