Physics Modules
=============

The LatticeToolbox is written with an aim toward lattice QCD calculations; 
hence it includes also modules focusing on physics analysis. For example 
modules that can reconstruct observables from measurements on configurations, 
and a module containing critical exponents for some 3-d
universality classes.
