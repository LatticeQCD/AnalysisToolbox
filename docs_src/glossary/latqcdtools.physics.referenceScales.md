```Python
_betaRangeWarn(beta, beta_range):
'''
Many of these ans√§tze a(beta) have coefficients that were determined by performing a fit within a certain
beta range. This warning flashes whenever you are using information outside of that range, where the ansatz
is less likely be to reliable.

Args:
    beta (float) or numpy array
    beta_range (array-like): min and max beta of range, in that order 
'''

```Python
a_div_r1(beta, year):
'''
Get a/r_1(beta).

Args:

    year (int/str): year that parameterization was determined 

Returns:

```Python
a_times_fk(beta, year):
'''
Get a*f_k(beta).

Args:
