- Update setup.py
- (Maybe) python -m pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel
- (Maybe) python -m pip install --upgrade twine
- If you need API token, it's saved in personal account area
- twine upload dist/*
- make sure you have a .pypirc in your home directory like this:
- python3 -m build

[distutils]
index-servers =
    pypi

[pypi]
username = __token__
password = pypi-somestuff

your experience was that putting in repository = ... ruined things.
it took you hours to figure that out because twine fails silently.
hopefully this is enough for you to figure it out next time.
