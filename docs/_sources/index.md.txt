AnalysisToolbox
===========

The AnalysisToolbox is a collection of Python tools written for statistical data analysis, with an aim specifically toward lattice field theory. It contains a variety of useful methods for these purposes, for example general jackknife and bootstrap routines that can calculate error bars of arbitrary functions of data. It also includes modules tailored for lattice field theory, such as methods for scale setting and universal quantities from commonly examined 3-d universality classes.
