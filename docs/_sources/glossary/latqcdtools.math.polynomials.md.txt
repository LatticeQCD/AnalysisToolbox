`Polynomial(coeffs=None)`

    A simple class for constructing polynomial-type functions. You can construct
    then call a polynomial of only even powers up to fourth order using, for example,
        p = Polynomial([A0, 0., A2, 0. A4])
        p(x)
    
`Rational(num_coeffs, den_coeffs)`

    A simple class for constructing rational-type functions.
